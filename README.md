## Overview 📝

The Payment System application integrates with the Stripe API to process payments. It includes two main components: 

- `MainActivity`: The main activity of the app, responsible for initializing Stripe, handling payment input, and confirming the payment.
- `PaymentGateway`: A separate class that demonstrates a server-side implementation using the Stripe Java library for creating payment intents.

The application utilizes the following dependencies: 

- `com.stripe.android:stripe-android`: The Stripe Android SDK for client-side payment processing.
- `com.stripe:stripe-java`: The Stripe Java library for server-side payment handling.
